## Assignment 1 â€“ Journey to the Dark Side ðŸŒ˜

- **Points:** 60 (4 points per exercise)
- **Due:** Friday, October 18 at 5:00pm

Welcome to Assignment 1 for [CS 253: Web Security](https://cs253.stanford.edu). âœ¨

We're doing client-side attacks! This assignment is all about Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Your goal is to come up with "attack inputs" that when entered into vulnerable websites allow you to execute code in the target's browser.

With Reflected XSS, you want to find a way to encode the attack input into a URL that can be sent to a target. When the URL is visited, your attack input is extracted from the URL by the server-side (or potentially client-side) code and executed in the target's browser.

With Stored XSS, you want to find a way to get your attack input stored more permanently, e.g. in the server's database, so that when your target visits a page constructed using this data at some point in the future, your attack code will execute in their browser.

The assignment takes the form of an interactive workshop that you'll run in your browser. This is what it looks like:

## Prepare

### Check your Node.js version

You should already have Node.js installed from the last assignment. For this assignment, it's highly recommended to use Node.js 12. Open your terminal and run this command to confirm you're running some version 12.x.x:

```sh
node --version
```

If not, you can install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) from the official site.

### Get the starter code

Run this command to clone the code with `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stanford-web-security/assign1.git
```

Enter the folder you just created:

```sh
cd assign1
```

Install the necessary local dependencies with `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

### Start the assignment

Run the local server:

```sh
npm start
```

Your browser should open up to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) where you can begin the assignment.

## Submit

### Before you submit

Ensure that the sanity tests pass:

```sh
npm test
```

This command just runs a basic sanity test that ensures your project passes `npm run lint`, has the right folder structure, and doesn't have any blank required files. If `npm test` doesn't report any errors that doesn't necessarily mean that you've solved every exercise perfectly!

**ðŸŒŸ PRO TIP: You can automatically fix most lint errors by running:**

```sh
npm run lint-fix
```

### Gradescope

We'll use [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) for submissions. Enroll with the code `97BGZB`.

### The moment of truth

When you're ready to submit your work, you'll upload the `src/` folder to Gradescope. It should include two files (`SOLUTIONS.md` and `SURVEY.md`).

You should submit early and often! There's no downside to repeatedly submitting your assignment.

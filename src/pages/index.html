<h2>Fall 2019</h2>

<p>
  This course is a comprehensive overview of web security. The goal is to build an understanding of the most common web attacks and their countermeasures. Given the pervasive insecurity of the modern web landscape, there is a pressing need for programmers and system designers improve their understanding of web security issues.
</p>

<p>
  We'll be covering the fundamentals as well as the state-of-the-art in web security.
</p>

<p>
  Topics include: Principles of web security, attacks and countermeasures, the browser security model, web app vulnerabilities, injection, denial-of-service, TLS attacks, privacy, fingerprinting, same-origin policy, cross site scripting, authentication, JavaScript security, emerging threats, defense-in-depth, and techniques for writing secure code. Course projects include writing security exploits, defending insecure web apps, and implementing emerging web standards.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  CS 142, or an equivalent amount of web development experience, a prerequisite. Another important prerequisite is that you are curious about web security and excited to learn clever attacks, defenses, and techniques for writing secure code.

  An introductory security course, such as CS155, is not a formal prerequisite, but will be very useful to you in this course (and beyond!).

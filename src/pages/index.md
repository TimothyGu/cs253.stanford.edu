## Fall 2019

This course is a comprehensive overview of web security. The goal is to build an understanding of the most common web attacks and their countermeasures. Given the pervasive insecurity of the modern web landscape, there is a pressing need for programmers and system designers improve their understanding of web security issues.

We'll be covering the fundamentals as well as the state-of-the-art in web security.

Topics include: Principles of web security, attacks and countermeasures, the browser security model, web app vulnerabilities, injection, denial-of-service, TLS attacks, privacy, fingerprinting, same-origin policy, cross site scripting, authentication, JavaScript security, emerging threats, defense-in-depth, and techniques for writing secure code. Course projects include writing security exploits, defending insecure web apps, and implementing emerging web standards.

## Meeting time and place

Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:30 PM - 2:50 PM in classroom [380-380Y](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=380-380Y)

## Communication

We will primarily use [Piazza](#TODO) for sending out course announcements and answering questions. Please make sure to [sign up](#TODO).

To submit anonymous feedback to us at any point during the quarter, you may use [this form](#TODO).

## Prerequisites

CS 142, or an equivalent amount of web development experience, a prerequisite. Another important prerequisite is that you are curious about web security and excited to learn clever attacks, defenses, and techniques for writing secure code.

An introductory security course, such as CS 155, is not a formal prerequisite, but will be very useful to you in this course (and beyond!). The material in this course goes beyond the web security material covered in CS 155.

## Course Policies

### Attendence

Attendance at lectures is mandatory. Do not enroll in this course if you are taking another course that meets at the same time.

### Grading

Each of the assignments is worth an equal portion (16.6%) your grade. There is no midterm or final exam.

### Collaboration Policy

You may discuss the assignments with other students and you may work together to come up with solutions to the problems. If you do so, you must list the name of your collaborators in the submission. Each student must write up their solutions independently.

### Late Submissions

You get three ‚Äúlate days‚Äù in total during the quarter. You may use a late day to submit an assignment after the deadline. You can use at most three late days for any single assignment, and you may only use late days in one-day increments (no partial late days).

If you submit an assignment more than 72 hours after the deadline, or if you submit an assignment late after running out of late days, you will receive **no credit** for the submission. Please submit your assignments on time and save your late days for extraordinary situations.

If you have questions about these policies, please ask us.
